            <p>Known for its natural beauty and excellent durability, kangaroo leather is a material that has been used to make objects of utility and beauty since time immemorial.  Responsibly managed, kangaroo leather is a natural and biodegradable material that can be used for a wide range of applications, including handbags, shoes, and accessories.</p>

                <p>Kangaroo leather has qualities that naturally select it for use in leather goods. It is light, supple and strong, making it the material of choice for many high-end products. Such items as premium quality football boots, motor cycle gloves and helicopter seats are made from kangaroo leather not to mention Indiana Jones’ iconic whip. When there is a need for flexibility, strength and durability kangaroo leather is the most suitable of all the leathers!</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Due to the population of Kangaroos needing to be culled, True Heart Unlimited tries to make as much use of the kangaroo leather by products as possible so that it doesn’t go to waste. Because all the Kangaroo Leather used in True Heart Unlimited products is sourced from wild Kangaroos there are sometimes imperfections in the leather. While some of these imperfections mean the leather cannot be used, other imperfections allow for unique textures. This is what makes True Heart Unlimited products unique as this texture makes every product unique and makes the product truly yours.</p>
