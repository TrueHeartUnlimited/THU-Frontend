            <p>On the 29th of July 2012, True Heart Unlimited founder and her husband visited the ‘Leather Bench’ Store in Camden, Maine USA.  They purchased 2 carry-on leather suitcases (black and red).  When they left the store, the husband turned to his wife and said “You have always loved leather.  Why don’t you start a leather business?” </p>
            <p>And that’s exactly what she did.</p>

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>She decided to visit a market in Brisbane to find a particular leather stall because she had purchased two handbags from the owner.  Once she found him, she asked whether he could make her a handbag that I had designed.  His initial answer was a flat ‘No’, then he came around to the idea, as I started to describe to him how simple my design is.  He reluctantly asked me to bring him the design and he would have a think about it. It was at this moment that True Heart Unlimited’s founder decided to design and make the handbags herself and on the 23rd of November, 2013 True Heart unlimited was founded. In July 2019, Jim Tsoutsouras came to work with True Heart Unlimited. Jim, being the owner of Cleon Designs, has been in the leather industry for 30 years.  He once had his own leather factory in Marrickville but closed that down due to high overheads, costs of rent and staff.  He now operates from the garage of his home and is one of the few leather manufacturers left in Australia.  He manufactures for the overseas markets and also sells online.</p>
                <p>Jim makes most of the handbags for True Heart Unlimited, however, if you are after something more bespoke make an enquiry. We at True Heart Unlimited can more than meet your needs.</p>
