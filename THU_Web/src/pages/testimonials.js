                <p>I decided to look into True Heart, after seeing a customer where I worked with, this incredibly beautiful bag, and I knew right then I had to have one.</p>
                <p>Being made in Australia, of exceptional quality kangaroo leather, and meaning I would be supporting a local small business, ticked all the boxes for me.</p>
                <p>Participating in the design process was such a great experience, from picking the colours, pattern design and style of bag and leather, meant seeing a part of me in the end result, which was perfect and exactly what I had wanted!!</p>
                <p>I have had mine now for over 18 months, and it still looks brand new. It has plenty of space, and several pockets, which is perfect for my needs. The clips and zips are very good quality and still all in perfect working order. If you are wanting to treat yourself with something truly and uniquely beautiful, I would not hesitate to say just do it! You will have people stopping you in the streets!</p>

                <p>My True Heart Unlimited kangaroo handbag is absolutely well made, stylish and trendy. I love the wonderful natural brown kangaroo leather that gets better as it gets older over time becoming softer and more malleable.  It is perfect size with different pouches for my mobile phone and even small objects.  It’s versatile and definitely my favourite everyday bag in the wardrobe.</p>
                <p>I would definitely recommend it to a friend!</p>
                <p>Thanks Thu / True Heart Unlimited for making such a wonderful handbag.</p>

                <p>My kangaroo leather bag from True Heart Unlimited is my Australian connection and memory, but also represents my identity better than anything else I can think of. I love it! I love it as I love Australia: personal, unique, and cool.</p>
                <p>I appreciate the passion put into making me a unique customized bag that not only fits my preferences, but represents me. The bag is not only mine, it is me. It represents me, shows me, and makes me. Going out, I start with the bag and built the colours and style from there.  Although I enjoy all the cool functionalities I particularly chose in close guidance with the designer, I most of all enjoy its style and what it does to my appearance.</p>
                <p>If you ever want a bag that is not only functional, but extends and defines you, I would certainly recommend you contact True Heart Unlimited. They listen, understand and create the bag you not even thought existed.</p>

                <p>I love my kangaroo leather handbag, it's so comfortable to carry. When Thu designed my bag she listened to everything I said and she came up with the perfect bag for me. I love the texture, size and the little extra detail Thu added for me. The interior has compartments that fit all my handbag necessities in perfectly. I use my bag almost every day now and it matches effortlessly with everything. I'd be lost without it as it's so functional. I would recommend a True Heart Bag to anyone.</p>

                <p>My first Introduction to the True Heart Unlimited range was during a ladies’ camping for cancer fundraiser weekend. Thu had a small market stall showcasing some of her handmade bags and she had kindly donated a black leather tote with a Purple Heart pocket on one side to be auctioned at the luncheon. I was thrilled to be the highest bidder and take home this gorgeous bag. I was impressed with the quality and uniqueness of her designs and even more so when she explained that she personally sourced the kangaroo leather and hand made them herself. I had never seen kangaroo leather but was impressed with how incredibly soft and durable it is.  The internal pockets, zippers and key holders are also very practical.</p>
                <p>I loved my black tote so much that I asked her to custom make another handbag for me. I love my handbag and like that no one else has a bag anything like it.</p>
                <p>I would have no hesitation in recommending these beautiful Australian owned and handmade bags.</p>
